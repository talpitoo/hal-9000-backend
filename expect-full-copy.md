## Frontend & beyond

Show me yours [design], I’ll show you mine <code>.

### Design 2 HTML

I am a UI developer with i++ years of experience — the glue between front-end, backend, and design. Not from an arts academy, but instinct tells me when a color palette is off or a space is missing between words. My core competency lies in the fine details.

### Accessibility

Web accessibility is ensured by staying up to date with the latest W3C standards, including WCAG 2.2, Section 508, WAI-ARIA, and Schema.org. Following these rules from the start ensures built-in SEO, smooth UX, quality code, and neat UI out of the box.

### Speed optimization

Performance is carefully fine-tuned. Core Web Vitals like LCP and CLS, async & defer, critical above-the-fold CSS, and seamless FOUT/FOIT/FOFT handling. Lazy loading, fast coding.

### Consultation

Overwhelmed by front-end details? I spot UI bottlenecks and tackle questions like ‘Are custom-looking checkboxes necessary?’, ‘How to ensure keyboard accessibility?’, or ‘Pixel-perfect vs. generic?’ — keeping the big picture in focus.

### AI

I can handle Git from the command line or SSH into a remote server, but I’m most confident with my AI copilot HAL 9000 — boosting productivity, filling gaps, and streamlining my workflow.

### Paw patrol

Brainstorming on four paws. I take long walks with my dogs to avoid burnout and let ideas marinate away from the screen.
