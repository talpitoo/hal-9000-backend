# Hello world, I'm freelancing!

**‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:** this website started in 2014 and has been updated from time to time, proceed with caution.
Yes, you are in the right place, and this is my _freelancing manifesto_.


## "Sass is more"

In the 90s the term was _"pixel perfect"_. I can't remember the exact year though, but I'm using the nineties as those were turbulent years in the country where I'm from. Today in the responsive era I would say _"generic"_. I was once a big fan of Bootstrap (nowadays TailwindCSS), which is great for achieving that genericness. But if you have a clear vision and care about details, we can go much deeper and achieve both precision and flexibility side by side! P.S. CSS custom properties (--variables) are the most!

## Glue

My business card once said _"Frontend developer, UI/UX designer"_ but call it what you like. What I'm best at is PSD2HTMLdesign2code, but you can find anybody for that. Why you are looking for me is the the quality of that HTML: semantic, accessible, SEO-friendly, WCAG compliant, WAI-ARIA, Schema.org structured, and future-proof. Colleagues liked working with me because I was the glue between backend, frontend, and design. I'm not from an art academy, but I feel it in my stomach if something is off in the color palette (and when a space is missing between words!). I've worked with a plethora of technologies, so there‚Äôs a good chance I‚Äôll understand what the backend team is talking about. I enjoy learning new tech, I can and do write backend code, but I prefer just to understand it. I can handle Git from the command line or SSH into a remote server, but I‚Äôm most effective when working alongside my AI copilot üî¥ HAL 9000 (whom I keep in check).


## Freelancing manifes`<tt>`o

If time is money I choose **my time**. Don't misinterpret me, I enjoy this [abstract state of mind](https://testedonhumans.xyz/) but I would rather do something else, e.g. lying in the fields and staring at the sky. The good ideas often come from those clouds (and even more often while cycling). If your project is **clever**, **useful** and **interesting** (and helps achieve [World Peace](https://testedonhumans.xyz/blog/word-peace/) ;-) you are at the right address.

If you‚Äôre still here, that‚Äôs excellent ‚Äî I‚Äôve just found the kind of collaborator I‚Äôve been looking for. Let‚Äôs build something to be proud of.
desk-top
When I'm not sitting in front of my computer I'm somewhere [up in the mountains](https://tothtamas.tt/portfolio/alterego/preikestolen-kjeragbolten-and-trolltunga/) or [cycling around](https://tothtamas.tt/portfolio/alterego/speed-limit/) with my Fuji X100T and this is my desk-top (throwback to 2014, with the tooling due for an update)
